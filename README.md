Poisonous potatoes contain an intelligence still poorly understood by science.

To leverage it, put stacks of poisonous potatoes (and other things) in a chest, then shift-right click it with another poisonous potato in hand.
Each different stack size is a different opcode.
Execution is stack-based, and goes across the inventory in slot order.

## Tutorial

lmao

Check `Spudcodes.java` for the instruction mapping.
If you wear a poisonous potato plant on your head then hovering over items will tell you their instruction.
